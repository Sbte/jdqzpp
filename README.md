# JDQZ++
Templated C++ implementation of the JDQZ generalized eigenvalue problem solver.

## Credits
 This is an almost 1-1 port of the original FORTRAN code by Fokkema and van Gijzen: http://www.win.tue.nl/casa/research/scientificcomputing/topics/jd/software.html  A few of the old routines survive and are compiled into a separate library.
